Description: GDK Pixbuf library (deprecated Xlib integration)
 This package contains a deprecated library to render GdkPixbuf structures
 to X drawables using Xlib (libX11).
 .
 No newly written code should ever use this library.
 .
 If your existing code depends on gdk-pixbuf-xlib, then you're strongly
 encouraged to port away from it.

Description: GDK Pixbuf library (transitional package)
 The GDK Pixbuf library provides:
  - Image loading and saving facilities.
  - Fast scaling and compositing of pixbufs.
  - Simple animation loading (ie. animated GIFs)
 .
 This transitional package depends on the main library libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0
 and the deprecated Xlib integration library libgdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0-0.
 .
 Packages that only require the main library should depend on
 libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0 | libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0.
 .
 Packages that require the Xlib integration should port away from it,
 or until that can be done, depend on
 libgdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0-0 | libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0.

Description: GDK Pixbuf library (development files)
 This package contains the header files which are needed for using
 GDK Pixbuf's deprecated Xlib integration.

 main library libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-0 and the deprecated Xlib integration
 library libgdk-pixbuf-xlib-2.0-0.
